# FreeCodeCamp Drum Machine Challenge

A functional, easy-mode solution to FCC's Drum machine challenge that was fun to code but doesn't pass the tests. Also, it uses animal sounds instead of drums. 

## Project Challenges:

I watched several tutorials on this project on YouTube and they all used React. I wanted to play around using only JavaScript and JQuery. Just to see what I could make with as little research as possible. The code may not look sophisticated but I had a lot of fun building it!

## Features:

- Created with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and JQuery
- Plays animal sounds when you click on or press specific buttons 
- When sound plays, a display shows what animal it is
